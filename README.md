React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
Expanding the ESLint configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the TS template for information on how to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint in your project.
